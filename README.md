# Online PD Risk Score Platform

## Motivation 
Generating risk scores is becoming more common, but what do they mean? Here, we are putting together a website with context around risk scores, the different types, how they translate into different populations, and publications. Also, we are creating a series of notebooks that can be deployed in a containerized Binder to calculate risk scores for your own data, linked on the website. 

In the future, plans include incorporating a calculator directly into the website, but we saw merit in developing both these sections individually.

Notebook Binder: `Coming Soon!`
